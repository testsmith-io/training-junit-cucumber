Feature: Using regular expressions
  As a novice Cucumber student
  I want to learn how to use regular expressions
  So I can write more expressive and powerful scenarios

  Scenario: Integer values only
    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
    And I have entered 70 into the calculator
    And I have entered banana into the calculator

  Scenario: Specific values only
    Given Maserati is an Italian car brand
    And Ferrari is an Italian car brand
    And Volkswagen is an Italian car brand

  Scenario: Optional characters
    Given I have 2 apples
    And I have 1 apple
